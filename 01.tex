\section{Objective}
Our contracted objective was to ascertain uses, if any, of subject 001.
Implicit in this objective is that damaging or removing components of the subject must be avoided.

\section{Introduction}

Subject 001 consists of two parts, which we refer to as the mineral and the setting.
The purpose is unknown.

The mineral appears to have been fashioned in a manner resembling a gem (cabochon cut).
Because of this observation, we have adopted some identifying methods and terms from gemology.

The setting appears to be an engineered metallic device of unknown function.
There is a layer of what may be either oxidation or some sort of protective coating; this layer has been scraped off on the setting's edges.

\section{Methods}
We endeavored to obtain as much information about the subject as possible with as little potential impact on it as was feasible.

The mineral's properties may be categorized as either physical or optical.
We used a $10\times$ hand lens and ultraviolet light to discern basic physical properties.
For optical properties, a $45\times$ polarizing gemological microscope, a dichroscope, and a refractometer were employed.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Basic physical characteristics}
The mineral is yellow in color, transparent, and has a vitreous luster.
Unfortunately, certain diagnostic features such as cleavage and fracture were obliterated with the cutting and polishing by --- we presume --- the creators of this artifact.
Other physical properties such as hardness and specific gravity could not be tested due to our instructions not to abrade the subject.

\subsection{Optical characteristics}
Using the tools outlined above, we determined that the optical properties of the mineral are similar to those of quartz.
Specifically, we measured the refractive index (\textsc{ri}) to be exactly 1.55.
We used a polarizing microscope and determined that the mineral is anisotropic; the dichroscope allowed us to determine that the mineral is doubly refractive.

\subsection{Mass irregularities}
While measurement of an object's mass seems so trivial as to belong in a grade-school lab report, our observations of the subject have led us to exercise a great deal of skepticism regarding the standard methods.
For example, a digital laboratory scale expresses its measurement in grams, which is a mass measurement --- but, in fact, the scale provides a measurement of force, not mass, and converts according to a calibration to the local gravitational field.

Several assumptions are implicit in such a measurement:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The object is subject only to gravitational force, and other forces (\textit{e.g.} magnetic) are tiny in comparison.
\item The object contains no regions that are of lower density than the atmosphere. Imagine, for example, a chamber containing helium at atmospheric pressure. Such a chamber would have an apparent weight less than that of an equivalent chamber containing standard atmosphere. Similarly, a chamber containing nothing --- a vacuum --- would weigh less than either the helium chamber or the atmosphere-containing chamber.
\item The object's temperature is at equilibrium with the environment (though this is only significant for gases and not solid objects, we mention it to be exhaustive in the face of confusing experimental results).
\end{enumerate}

Based on our observations, none of these assumptions necessarily apply.
Firstly, the subject produces a stronger than expected magnetic field based upon its apparent composition, and confusingly, the subject's dipole moment appears to rotate.
Not only does the dipole moment rotate, but it does so seemingly \textit{in tandem} with the placement of either a magnetometer or a simple compass relative to the artifact.
Bewilderingly, the magnetic force appears to fall off more quickly as distance increases than would be expected for, say, a current-carrying loop.
We observed that, rather than obeying an inverse-cube law, the magnetic force seems consistent with an inverse-fifth or sixth-power law.

We next attempted to observe the weight of the subject, but found that the weight changed as we re-oriented the subject.
Indeed, when we cycled back through the orientations a second time, the apparent weight differed by up to around five percent from the first set of measurements.
When tested in the early afternoon, the scale recorded an average mass of 40.2 grams with a standard deviation of 1.2 grams.
We repeated the experiment an hour later and recorded an average mass of 41.5 grams --- again with a standard deviation of 1.2 grams.
Unfortunately, we were not allowed to keep the artifact any longer, which rather limited our ability to discern any meaningful trend.

However, one of us (Amie) noticed a peculiarity: the subject behaves extremely oddly when placed in a centrifuge.
We lacked the proper measurement tools, but observed that a 40-gram weight placed on the opposite end of a 0.25-meter centrifuge from the artifact produced a substantial imbalance.
We calculated a difference of roughly a tenth of a newton (order of magnitude, not exact) between the weight (mean) due to gravity and the weight due to centripetal acceleration.
It does not escape our notice that this odd behavior could actually allow the subject to be used as an energy source --- though further study is needed to determine whether the apparent weight correlates with the temperature.

We attempted to ascertain the volume of the device by placing it in a known volume of water and measuring the displacement.
Remarkably, despite apparently being made of materials significantly denser than water, it floated.
We next tried to use a straightened paperclip to push it down into the water, and measured a volume of around 100 ml.
However, the temperature of the paperclip increased rapidly, apparently through contact with the artifact. 
Indeed, Luke's fingers were burned.
We observed that the temperature of the water had increased substantially --- by nearly twenty degrees Celsius in under a minute.
Further tests revealed the subject to be emitting broadly in the infrared.
Additionally, we found that the temperature increase was specific to the application of a downward force in water.
A downward force on a table produced no temperature change, nor did a sideways force in water --- though the temperature did increase when Luke inadvertently pushed slightly downward instead of sideways.
The temperature change did not appear to be sensitive to where we pushed (on the gem or the setting).
Again, it seems obvious that a device which rapidly produces so much heat when pushed underwater could serve as a rather simple and straightforward source of electricity; however, it is unclear where the energy for the temperature increase originates, and we prescribe several more weeks of testing.

\caption{\textbf{The application of downward force produces rapid temperature change in water.} A sideways force does not produce a change. The increase between 10 and 20 seconds on the `water sideways' time-points corresponds to inadvertent downward pressure. The `table sideways' plot temperature readings were taken with the temperature probe being used to push the subject, and thus reflect the subject temperature rather than water temperature.}

\subsection{Radioactivity}
Our observations consistently showed the subject to be unremarkable in terms of its alpha, beta, and gamma emissions.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}
The subject responds unexpectedly to stimuli, based on its behavior in water and in the presence of a magnetometer.

The physical and optical properties of the mineral are consistent with those of lime citrine variety quartz.
Therefore, we believe it reasonable to consider other properties typically associated with quartz, which is known to have piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties.
These properties could help explain some of the unusual behaviors, such as the transmission of heat while submerged.
Given additional time, we recommend targeting investigations toward these properties.
 
The four hours of study we were permitted on the subject were insufficient for fully interrogating the range of possibilities produced by our testing, and the tests we performed have produced more questions than answers.

We urge extreme caution when transporting the subject due to its unpredictable behavior in a gravitational field.
It is unclear how the artifact would behave, for example, in orbit or on the way to orbit.\footnote{This type of information was not recorded when the subject was initially retrieved from 2000~\textsc{sg}344, the Aten asteroid where it was found. Frustratingly, the operators of the inbound re\"entry vehicle would not provide us with flight logs, arguing that the proprietary nature of their flight software and propulsion systems `regrettably' did not allow them to share those data.} Similarly, the rapid temperature increase could pose a serious fire hazard, and we lacked sufficient time to determine if submersion in other materials would also produce rapid heating.
